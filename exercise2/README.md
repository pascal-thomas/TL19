# Exercise 2

Objective: Custom loginscreen presented to users

Expected duration: 15 minutes

In the supplied application at the location /apps/TL19/login there is a custom loginscreen.

## Setting the custom login screen

First specify the new loginscreen in the OSGi-settings.

1. Go to http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr
2. Search for 'Adobe Granite Login Selector Authentication Handler'
3. In that configuration screen, set the following value for 'Default Login Page':
/apps/TL19/login
4. Go to another browser and try the custom loginscreen (http://localhost:4502 would bring up the loginpage)

NOTE: See the path changing in your browser from /libs to /apps

## Change the background images

The images are stored at the location /apps/TL19/login/clientlib/resources/bg/default, they are named to the resolution.

(In finder do "Shift+command+G" and fill in                                                             
~/Downloads/TL19-master/code/TL19/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/TL19/login/clientlib/resources/bg/default)

Use the same image-names when you change the images, otherwise you need to change stylesheets as well.

You can find an examples for your screenresolution at: cd Downloads/TL19-master/images

For the desktop, use the following resolutions:
- 2048x1536.jpg
- 1280x768.jpg
- 1024x710.jpg

Once the images are replaced, you need to redeploy your application.
When the application is redeployed, then you can reload the loginpage to see the new background image.

## Customize the login screen
NOTE: The instructions below are done directly in CRX/DE.

Of course you can do them also in your IDE, then deploy into AEM.

Now you can customize it to your own needs.  

Other things your can change:

### Links at the bottom  
/apps/TL19/login/configs/cq/footer/items

### Background images  
/apps/TL19/login/clientlib/resources/bg

### Description in the login form  
/apps/TL19/login/configs/cq/box

### Title of the loginpage  
/apps/TL19/login/configs/cq

### Copyright text  
/apps/TL19/login/configs/cq/footer/copy

## Enabling environment indicator

This enables a handy indicator to show at what environment you are.

1. Go to the OSGi configuration console (localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
2. Go the following configuration: ACS AEM Commons - AEM Environment Indicator
3. Set the values as follows:
- color: purple
- CSS override: #acs-commons-env-indicator { 	background-color: #6321D7;  	
color: #FFF;  
position: fixed;
top: 0;
left: 50%;
width: 126px;
margin-left: -63px;
height: 30px;  	
font: bold 18px/29px sans-serif;
text-align: center; 	 	
border: solid 1px black;
border-top-width: 0;
z-index: 100000000000000;
}
- Inner HTML: TL19
- Browser title: TL19

After saving the changes, you will see the indicator being shown on every screen in the author environment.
